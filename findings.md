# 🔍 Project Findings & Constraints

## Research
- Competitor analysis shows high value in transparent pricing and "tech-forward" visualization.
- "Holographic" elements increase engagement time.

## Constraints
- **Mobile Visibility**: Background elements (like the holographic car) need higher opacity on mobile due to smaller screens and ambient light.
- **Scrollbars**: Horizontal scrollbars on carousels need explicit hiding (`.scrollbar-hide`) for polished look.
- **Hero Text Density**: Desktop subtext (~140 chars) is acceptable but could be tightened for impact.
- **Mobile Buttons**: `size="lg"` buttons stacked vertically consume ~130px height. Consider `size="md"` or side-by-side layout for better fold usage.
